# MOMO Fit üéÄüê±üí™

### Overview
MOMO Fit is a SwiftUI-based social fitness app designed to help users stay accountable for their gym habits by connecting with friends. The app enables users to:

- Update their gym status 

- Write and share a short custom status message 

- View live updates from friends!

The original vision was to make fitness more social, supportive, and fun through lightweight daily interactions. Our MVP(Minimum Viable Product) reflects this with an aesthetically pleasing pastel-themed UI, an animated mascot named MOMO, and a seamless real-time friend system. Together, these features promote a positive, motivating environment for users to track and share their fitness habits.

All user data ‚Äì including gym status, messages, and friend connections ‚Äì is stored securely using Firebase, ensuring effortless syncing, authentication, and real-time updates.
